### Submission Steps

**Each student needs to individually submit their own work.**

1. Create a plain text file called `SUBMISSION.md` directly inside the `cs1302-ce05`
   directory with the following information.

   1. Your name and UGA ID number;
   1. Collaborator names, if any; and
   1. The full link to the website generated in this exercise.

   Here is an example of the contents of `SUBMISSION.md`.

   ```
   1. Sally Smith (811-000-999)
   2. Collaborators: Joe Allen, Stacie Mack
   3. https://webwork.cs.uga.edu/~user/cs1302-ce05-doc
   ```

1. Change directories to the parent of `cs1302-ce05` (e.g., `cd ..` from `cs1302-ce05`). If you would like
   to make a backup tar file, the instructions are in the submissions steps for [ce02](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce02).
   We won't repeat those steps here and you can view them as optional.

1. Use the `submit` command to submit this exercise to `csci-1302`:

   ```
   $ submit cs1302-ce05 csci-1302
   ```

   Read the output of the submit command very carefully. If there is an error while submitting, then it will displayed
   in that output. Additionally, if successful, the submit command creates a new receipt file in the directory you
   submitted. The receipt file begins with rec and contains a detailed list of all files that were successfully submitted.
   Look through the contents of the rec file and always remember to keep that file in case there is an issue with your submission.

   **Note:** You must be on Odin to submit.
